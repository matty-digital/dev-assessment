Matt Bowytz Developer Asessment


## Notes
- I was having some issues with connecting to the api. Not sure if it was them or me.
- The images coming from the api had some non transparent borders, I adjusted them to look a little better
- This would be best viewed in chrome. I didn't put some vendor prefixes, but I figured things like that wouldn't be a huge deal
- I matched the mocks as well as I could with a jpg file. Some fonts may appear differently and some hex codes may be a little off  

## Run
- Get apache running and place this directory in the htdocs (or web or whatever you call yours)
- .htaccess is handling the landing page so just going to `/dev/assessment/` should do the tricks

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!!!
